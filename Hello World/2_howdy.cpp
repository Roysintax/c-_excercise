  // Don’t worry if it’s confusing, we will learn more about each of these lines.
  //
  // The line that’s the most important to us right now is:
  //
  // std::cout << "Howdy! 🤠"; 
  //
  // In C++, the std::cout statement, short for character output, tells the terminal to output a message. It’s followed by <<, two left arrows. The message we want to display should be surrounded by " double quotes. And every C++ statement ends with a ; semicolon.
  //
  // Together, this is a cout statement (pronounced "see-out"). We are going to use this a lot.
  //
  // In the code above, we instructed our program to output a message. The resulting text that is displayed in the terminal is referred to as the output.
  //
  // The output of the message would be:
  //
  // Howdy! 🤠
  //
  // Now that we understand more about outputting messages, let’s try it again!
  //
  // add as comment
  cout << "Nada! 💖";
