//#include <iostream>

//int main() {
    
    // After we declare a variable, then we can give it a value to store!
    // Let’s use the score variable one more time.
    //int score;

    //score = 0;

    // score is the variable name.
    // = means assignment.
    // ; to end a statement.

    // In C++, an = equal sign doesn’t really mean “equal”. It’s more of a verb… it means “assign”. 
    // Here, we are assigning the score variable a value of 0.
    
    // And you can update the value however many times you want later in the program:
    
    // int score; (Variable already declared above)

    //score = 0;
    //score = 10;
    //score = 8;
    //score = 10;

    //std::cout << score;   // Output: 10

    // Notice how here, we didn't put double quotes around the score variable. 
    // This is because we can print the value of a variable by putting the variable name after the <<.
    
    // One more thing! We can combine the declaration and the initialization of a variable into one line. 
    // So the code above can be:
    
    // int score = 0; (Commented out because 'score' is already declared)

    //score = 10;
    //score = 8;
    //score = 10;

    // Note: A variables only needs to be declared once.
    // Let’s try it out!

  //  return 0;
//}
